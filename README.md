☕ Coffee Shop Project

A simple Python program that models a coffee shop using object-oriented programming (OOP). It includes three main classes: `Customer`, `Coffee`, and `Order`.

Description

- A Customer can place many Orders.
- A Coffee can have many Orders.
- An **Order** links one Customer to one Coffee at a given price.

This setup creates a many-to-many relationship between customers and coffees through orders.
